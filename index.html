        <p class="about-me">
            My name is Jadyn Gomez and I am a 21-year-old novice web developer who is passionate about learning about coding and 
            creating dynamic, user-friendly websites. I was born and raised in a bilingual household, 
            I am fluent in both English and Spanish, which has allowed me to connect with a 
            diverse range of people and cultures throughout my life.<br />
            <br />
            After completing high school, I decided to pursue a phlebotomy degree and I loved it, but when I moved to New Jersey recently to live with my boyfriend Alex (who you can see in the picture above) no one was really hiring, so I decided to indulge in to a totally different degree.
            I started taking an interest in web design and just code in general, which led me to enrolling in a web development bootcamp program. This intensive program 
            seems to be teaching me everything from basic HTML and CSS to advanced JavaScript and React development.<br />
            <br />
            Throughout the course of the bootcamp so far, I believe I have proved to be a motivated and dedicated student, and I am
            always eager to learn and improve my skills. I am consistently putting in the hours of my own time, often staying up late into the night to work on my projects and assignments.
            <br />
            In my free time, I enjoy playing videogames with Alex, reading, and spending time with my family and 
            friends. I also enjoy dabbling in drawing every now and again, mostly when it comes to drawing Pokemon for Alex or a heartfelt birthday card. Eventually, 
            I want to get around to traveling and enjoying the different cultures offered around the world.
